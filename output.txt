Q1 ::

Please find output : 

 BEGIN Display of Adjacency list 
0: 1,2,
1: 2,
2: 
3: 4,5,
4: 5,
5: 
 END Display of Adjaceny list 
 BEGIN Display of Adjacency matrix 
0:0,1,1,0,0,0,
1:0,0,1,0,0,0,
2:0,0,0,0,0,0,
3:0,0,0,0,1,1,
4:0,0,0,0,0,1,
5:0,0,0,0,0,0,
 END Display of Adjaceny matrix 

 Adjacency list and matrix are same , they correlate with the edges added too !

 Q2 :: 

For Adjacency List and performing DFS , BFS using same
to get connected components as below

 Begin Connected Components using DFS ! 
0 1 2 
3 4 5 
 End Connected Components using DFS ! 
 Begin Connected Components using BFS ! 
0 1 2 
3 4 5 
 End Connected Components using BFS !
